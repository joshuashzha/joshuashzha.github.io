In my free time, I like reading books not constrained to science related. I like classical novels and my favourite is "圍城" (Fortress Besieged) by Zhongshu Qian (錢鐘書). I like outdoor activities such as basketball, swimming, and hiking. Chatting with friends with "left" thought is another habit. I also played quite some computer games earlier in the university, particularly DoTA and Three Kingdoms. I listened to older mandarin songs and Cantonese songs by Eason Chan and other singers. Now I am learning to enjoy classics by Beethoven, Mozart, or Wagner? I have always wished that I can play some musical instruments though never realized.
