My name is Shuai Zha (查帥) and I am now a Ph.D. candidate in Department of Physics, the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The English name \"Joshua\" was given by my American friend Alfred as it sounds like my Mandarin name. For my research interest, please refer to the research page. I was born in Anhui province, China, which is famous for the beautiful Yellow Mountain. This cover photo was taken by an old friend Shantao Li at Saikong Beach, Hong Kong in 2010, which is one of my best memories.
