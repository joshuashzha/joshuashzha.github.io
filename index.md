# Shuai Zha (查帥)

I am now a Ph.D. candidate under supervision of [MC Chu](http://www.phy.cuhk.edu.hk/people/chu.html) and [LM Lin](http://www.phy.cuhk.edu.hk/people/lin-lm.html) in [Department of Physics, the Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.phy.cuhk.edu.hk).

I work on stellar evolution and supernovae simulations. For my detailed research interest, please refer to the research page.

I was born in Anhui province, China, which is famous for the beautiful Yellow Mountain.
