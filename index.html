## Shuai Zha (查帥)
![szha photo](/assets/szha_cover.jpg "Shuai")
I am now a Ph.D. candidate under supervision of MC Chu and LM Lin in Department of Physics, the Chinese University of Hong Kong. I work on stellar evolution and supernovae simulations. For my detailed research interest, please refer to the research page.  
 
I was born in Anhui province, China, which is famous for the beautiful Yellow Mountain.   

This cover photo was taken by an old friend Shantao Li at Saikong Beach, Hong Kong in 2010, which is one of my best memories.
